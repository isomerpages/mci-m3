<h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
<p>Singapore’s Malay/Muslim community makes up about 15% of the total population.
Being a minority Muslim community in a multi-religious and multi-racial
society, we sit in a very unique position and has successfully thrived
in many different areas. Since independence, we have achieved significant
progress, especially in the areas of employment and education.</p>
<p>With these progress, we have seen greater social mobility and better outcomes
across generations. Despite being a minority group, we constantly punched
above our weight in various fields, including in areas such as religion,
arts, and sports. Underpinning these successes are the 3 core values of
a Community of Success represented by the 3Cs – good <strong>Character</strong>,
strong <strong>Competency</strong>, and active <strong>Citizenry</strong>.
The community embodies these core values in our everyday lives, in pursuit
of living well with sound religious principles, ensuring that we remain
competent and relevant in terms of skills, and lastly, contributing back
not just to the community but also to the nation.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Values</strong></h3>
<p>What makes the Singapore Malay/Muslim community unique is that we embrace
a positive and forward-looking vision of Islam that enables our community
to thrive and actively contribute back to the country, one which is plural
and contemporary. This mindset is especially critical for Muslim communities
living in such secular and diverse social contexts where socio-religious
challenges are increasingly more complex. Therefore, we believe in the
vision of building a Muslim Community of Success that is underpinned by
the 3Cs – good Character, strong Competency, and active Citizenry. These
3Cs enable the community to be more confident, independent, and civic-minded
to look beyond just ourselves, but also the people around us.</p>
