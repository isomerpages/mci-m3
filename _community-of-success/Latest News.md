<h1>Wakaf Masyarakat Singapura</h1>

<p>Wakaf Masyarakat Singapura (WMS) was officially launched on 3 August 2024
by Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli. WMS, a new Islamic
Endowment Fund by the community for the community, creates a long-term
sustainable funding stream for the evolving needs of the Singapore Muslim
community.</p>
<p>The establishment of WMS comes back to two important reasons:</p>
<p>A good Islamic practice and tradition. Our forefathers have bequeathed
their land and properties for specific purposes that benefit the wider
community, as guided by Islamic principles. We now have 91 Wakaf, as an
Amanah, entrusted for us to preserve them for future generations. This
is a practice that we can learn from and build on – but the last wakaf
was contributed a long time back in 1978.</p>
<p>Renewing our mosque land leases. In the next 30 years, we will need at
least $300 million to renew our mosque land leases in quick succession.
Our existing community funds such as the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund
(MBMF) and Zakat can support the community’s current operation needs. But
in the long term, we need to do more to strengthen our religious institutions
such as madrasahs, and develop our Asatizah sector.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By establishing the WMS, we will allow ourselves a long runway to raise
smaller tranches of funds over time and generate a resilient income stream
to support our future growing needs.</p>
