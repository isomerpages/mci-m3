<p>At the annual Minister's Hari Raya Get-Together, Minister-in-Charge of
Muslim Affairs, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, reflected on the remarkable progress
the Malay/Muslim (MM) community has made over the past 60 years.</p>
<p>We have come far - through working hand-in-hand with other communities
to contribute to the well-being of the broader society, while shaping a
better future for all Singaporeans.</p>

</div>
<p>The next five years hold many exciting milestones for the MM community.
Later this year, the first Forum of Regional Communities of Success will
be convening with friends from Cambodia, the Philippines &amp; Thailand.
Featuring three components, the forum will induct the first batch participants
to the Communities Of Success Programme 2.0 (COSP 2.0). Volunteers from
the MM community will get the chance to visit regional partners to share
their experience through capacity-building programmes. Scholarships or
attachments to Muslim secondary school students from these countries to
study in our local madrasah are also being explored. The second half of
this year will be an exciting one!</p>
<p>There are many developments that the community can look forward to in
the coming year. These reflect our shared aspirations for a thriving Community
of Success and positions us as a global example for minority communities
everywhere. Let us remain steadfast in our commitment to grow while honouring
the foundations laid by our pioneers. By staying united, supporting one
another, and building on the progress of past generations, we can continue
charting a promising future for generations to come!</p>

<p>At the Committee Of Supply (Muslim Affairs) debates, Minister-in-charge
of Muslim Affairs, Masagos Zulkifli, unveiled strategies to develop the
asatizah sector.</p>
<p>The main strategy to enhance the attractiveness of our asatizah sector
is through the Common Salary Guideline (CSG) which will be implemented
in stages. Since 2023, the salaries of asatizah working in mosques and
religious schools have increased by more than 80% to meet the salary ceiling
of CSG, with an average salary increase of 5% to 12%.</p>

<h1><strong>Singapore’s next chapter in building a Malay/Muslim community of success</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>By Minister Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for Social and Family Development and Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs, Second Minister for Health.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/IMG_3645.jpg">
</div>
<p>In 2018, as Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, I officiated the Islamic
Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) annual zakat distribution to lower-income
families for the first time.</p>
<p>Back then, I asked whether the families were known to the Malay/Muslim
community's self-help group Mendaki<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mendaki-is-better-meeting-malaymuslim-community-s-needs-zaqy-mohamad" class="anchor-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> </a>and
whether the children were enrolled in its programmes. As it turned out,
they were not.</p>
<p>Mendaki has many good programmes which have uplifted the educational achievements
of the community over the years under the leadership of successive ministers.</p>
<p>I thought then that while these programmes were effective, they had not
been scaled widely enough to reach every family in need.</p>
<p>A similar observation arose with the People’s Association Malay Activity
Executive Committees Council (PA Mesra).</p>
<p>The group – meant to bring the Malay community together – was sizeable,
but its membership and leadership had stagnated over the years, lacking
the renewal needed to stay relevant and dynamic.</p>
<p>The community had achieved considerable success, but was confronted by
new challenges.</p>
<p>As I took on the role of Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, I contemplated:
How could the community build on its past successes? What would its next
bound be?</p>
<p>These questions sparked the genesis of M<sup>3</sup> (M-cube).</p>
<p>It was&nbsp;an initiative to bring the three key Malay/Muslim institutions&nbsp;–
Muis, Mendaki and PA Mesra – under a single umbrella for stronger collaboration
and to better support the community’s needs.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of M<sup>3</sup>,&nbsp;the three institutions
engaged the community effectively but operated independently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals seeking their services had to approach each agency separately,
as there was no structured framework for inter-agency coordination.</p>
<p>The idea was simple: Collaborate to achieve more. As the name M<sup>3</sup> suggests,&nbsp;the
aim wasn’t just to add value – it was to multiply it and create a bigger,
lasting impact.</p>
<h4>M<sup>3</sup> in action</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PHOTO_2024_07_03_15_19_52.jpg">
</div>
<p>Once the organisations began working in synergy, we could focus on refreshing
existing programmes and creating new ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>M<sup>3</sup> was to become the rallying call for the community – bringing
the Government, community leaders and volunteers together to confront the
challenges of the day.</p>
<p>The first mission was to strengthen last-mile service delivery by ensuring
that services provided by one organisation were made accessible to the
immediate clients of another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We began with the five focus areas: strengthening marriages, parenthood
and early childhood education, supporting vulnerable individuals and families,
youth empowerment and mentoring, employment and employability, and health.</p>
<p>Our goal was clear – to enhance last-mile service delivery, ensuring that
help would reach those who need it the most, with no one falling through
the cracks.</p>
<p>To make a direct impact and tap into the expertise of professionals, we
established 11 M<sup>3</sup>@Towns across the island.</p>
<p>These local hubs fostered collaboration at the community level, bringing
M<sup>3</sup>’s services closer to the ground.</p>
<h4>Building a community of success</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PHOTO_2024_07_03_15_22_07.jpg">
</div>
<p>M<sup>3</sup> laid a solid foundation for the Malay/Muslim community to
pursue its vision of becoming a community of success – a vision defined
by three key pillars: Character, competency and citizenry.</p>
<p>First, I believe our community’s unique character is deeply rooted in
the practice of Islam which upholds values of care and compassion.</p>
<p>At the inaugural International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS)
in 2022, prominent religious scholars from around the world reached a consensus:
minority Muslim communities can greatly benefit from a body of knowledge
that guides them in applying Islam in context.</p>
<p>This perspective reinforces the importance of being valued citizens of
our country – contributing to peace, harmony and progress. In Singapore’s
multiracial and multi-religious society, this affirmation holds even greater
significance.</p>
<p>It is because of this unique character that the Malay/Muslim community
could respond to the Covid-19 crisis calmly.</p>
<p>The community contributed to the national effort at containing the pandemic,
including postponing the haj pilgrimage and not congregating for the weekly
Friday prayers. They even conformed to the safe management measures during
Hari Raya visiting.</p>
<p>Recently when confronted with the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Mufti guided
the community to remain calm and pray for peace.</p>
<p>The community funnelled its energy towards <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-charity-raises-over-2-6m-to-fund-humanitarian-aid-for-children-families-in-gaza" class="anchor-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">providing aid for the Palestinians,</a> with
organisations like the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation raising a record
$12.8 million to date for the people of Gaza during this recent conflict.</p>
<p>Second, we aim to build competency by empowering the community to excel
in education. Our goal is to nurture the next generation of Malay/Muslim
professionals and entrepreneurs who will take on leadership roles across
the private, public and people sectors.</p>
<p>Third, in building a united and strong Muslim community, we aspire to
develop an active citizenry – one that contributes to nation-building and
passionately gives back to the wider Singapore society.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is about building trust with other communities. By staying
strong, united and engendering trust with other communities, we can confidently
and courageously tackle the challenges ahead.</p>
<h4>Our progress</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/IMG_7091.jpg">
</div>
<p>I am proud of the Malay/Muslim community’s achievements thus far. In just
five years, we have achieved considerable scale in reaching out and uplifting
the community.</p>
<p>Many have benefited from the enhanced accessibility of various community
programmes under M<sup>3</sup>. Mendaki’s KelasMateMatika (KMM) early childhood
initiative has supported over 10,000 parents and children.</p>
<p>The Bersamamu programme has helped more than 30,000 couples strengthen
marital foundations through marriage preparation courses.</p>
<p>Beyond these, other M<sup>3</sup> programmes have begun to positively impact
our youth, workers and families in larger numbers.</p>
<p>Thanks to the combined efforts of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC)
and Mendaki, we’ve seen an increase in the proportion of Malays who hold
PMET (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) positions from
23.4 per cent in 2000 to 39 per cent in 2020.</p>
<p>We’ve also witnessed a vast reduction in the two-year recidivism rate
of Malay ex-offenders, from 35 per cent for the 2011 release cohort to
26 per cent for the 2021 cohort.</p>
<p>We have also built a strong pool of volunteers who played an instrumental
role throughout this journey.</p>
<p>I’m heartened by the strong support of our 850 volunteers across 11 M<sup>3</sup>@Towns,
who have devoted their time and talent to connect M<sup>3</sup>’s last-mile
service delivery to citizens in need.</p>
<p>These volunteers are Malay/Muslim professionals from various fields –
lawyers, doctors, engineers, social workers and civil servants – whom we
called on to step up to give back to the community.</p>
<p>I’m pleased that they have the spirit of paying it forward. They volunteer
their time and expertise at M<sup>3</sup>@Towns and contribute to ground-up
initiatives. One example is the group of lawyers who provide essential
pro bono legal services to the community and recently established a formal
organisation, Peguam, to offer help in a more structured way.</p>
<p>Our achievements as a community have not gone unnoticed. Our success story
has been seen as a model for other Muslim minority communities internationally.</p>
<p>In October 2024, Singapore hosted the second ICCOS, bringing together
leaders of Muslim minority communities from around the world.</p>
<p>The conference focused on sharing experiences in integrating religious
and cultural diversity while addressing socio-religious challenges in a
multicultural society.</p>
<p>I am glad many of our young Muslims participated and heard first-hand
the positive feedback from international participants about our model of
religious and racial harmony.</p>
<p>This experience, I believe, instilled a strong sense of pride in all of
us as Singaporean Muslims.</p>
<h4>The road ahead</h4>
<p>Today, the Malay/Muslim community operates from an ever greater position
of strength.</p>
<p>We have an exciting journey ahead. I am optimistic that the five years
ahead will be even better than the five years before.</p>
<p>To mark the culmination of five years of our renewed spirit of collaboration,
the M<sup>3 </sup>Forum was held, bringing together 4,000 volunteers –
both new and veterans. In his speech, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong outlined
the Government’s plans to work alongside the Malay/Muslim community to
shape the next phase of development.</p>
<p>We look forward to upcoming plans such as the establishment of the Singapore
College of Islamic Studies (SCIS), the rejuvenation of the Geylang Serai
Cultural Belt, the reopening of the Malay Heritage Centre in Kampong Glam
and the restoration works of the Sultan Mosque.</p>
<p>SCIS represents an important milestone for the community. It seeks to
groom our future religious teachers (asatizah) with the knowledge and skills
to provide contexualised religious guidance for Muslim communities living
in diverse and contemporary societies like Singapore.</p>
<p>Through these efforts, we will instil noble character in the next generation
of Muslims. The recently established Wakaf Masyarakat Singapura (Singapore
Community Endowment) will play an important role in supporting the long-term
socio-religious needs of our Malay/Muslim community.</p>
<p>This will empower our community to become self-reliant and capable of
addressing the needs of future generations.</p>
<p>Similarly, we look forward to the revitalisation of our cultural precincts
in Kampong Glam and Geylang Serai. These iconic spaces hold a special place
in the hearts of Malay/Muslims, as they are integral to our heritage, telling
the stories of our community’s rich history and culture.</p>
<h4>Building our future together</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/WhatsApp_Image_2025_01_07_at_3_08_52_PM.jpg">
</div>
<p>I am deeply thankful to all who have joined us on this journey. In addition
to the collective efforts of M<sup>3 </sup>agencies, we are also grateful
for the contributions of several other Malay/Muslim organisations. We also
appreciate the strong support of government agencies and partners.</p>
<p>Mufti of Singapore, Dr Nazirudin Nasir, shared a hadith (sayings or traditions
of Prophet Muhammad) in one of his Friday sermons: “Whichever part of the
date palm tree you take, it is sure to be of benefit.” Mufti elaborated
that the character of a confident, resilient and empowered Muslim is like
a date palm tree that provides protection to others and contributes meaningfully
to the world.</p>
<p>If a Muslim is like a date palm tree, then our community is like a date
farm – a farm that thrives on collective strength. It flourishes when we
work together with others in various areas, building trust with other communities
and the Government.</p>
<p>This year, Singapore celebrates SG60. This is a significant milestone
for our country, a celebration of how far we have progressed as a nation,
and an occasion to rally all Singaporeans to build our future Singapore
together.</p>
<p>In a similar way, SG60 presents an opportunity for the Malay/Muslim community
to reflect on how far we have come as a community of success, and to re-commit
ourselves to the cause of uplifting fellow members of our community and
Singapore.</p>
<p>As the Malay proverb goes, “seikat bak sirih, serumpun bak serai”. The
road ahead may be fraught with challenges and uncertainties, but it also
brings hopes and opportunities for a brighter future.</p>
<p>I am confident that the Malay/Muslim community will continue to stand
together in unity and solidarity, to build a bright future for our next
generation.</p>

<h1><strong>M³ Forum: Celebrating 5 Years of M³</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/collage.jpg">
</div>
<p>M<sup>3</sup> celebrates its 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year, marking
a huge milestone in the efforts to uplift the Malay/Muslim community. To
cap off the celebrations, over 1,000 community partners including Malay/Muslim
organisations, professionals, and dedicated M³@Towns volunteers gathered
on 10 November 2024 at the M<sup>3</sup> Forum to celebrate this momentous
occasion. We were also honoured to have Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in
attendance as he gave a rousing speech in which he reiterated the Government’s
commitment to support the Malay/Muslim community in achieving its vision
of a Community of Success. PM Wong announced three transformative projects
set to enrich the Malay/Muslim community’s cultural and educational landscape.</p>
<p>One of which is the Singapore College of Islamic Studies (SCIS). This
college will serve as a monumental educational institution to shape future
asatizah with the confidence to address contemporary challenges in Singapore’s
multi-racial and multi-religious context.</p>
<p>Additionally, the rejuvenation of the Geylang Serai Cultural Belt, featuring
a revitalised Tanjong Katong Complex, and the reopening of the Malay Heritage
Centre at Kampong Gelam, will breathe new life into Singapore’s heritage
spaces. A major upgrade to Sultan Mosque is also slated for next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event also marked the launch of M³'s fifth anniversary book titled
‘Realising the Vision of a Community: The M³ Journey’ published by Berita
Harian. Inspired by the resilience of the Malay/Muslim community through
challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, the book chronicles M³’s collaborative
achievements since its inception and stands as an inspiration for volunteers,
and a guide for leaders.</p>
<p>In addition, awards were presented to outstanding volunteers and for special
projects, honouring the invaluable contributions that have helped shape
M³'s impact over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minister Maliki also provided an update on the Organisation Volunteer
initiative launched earlier this year, rallying support from organisations
and corporations to encourage employees to give back through Project Dian.
Changi General Hospital (CGH) is the first to step forward, recently leading
an enriching KidZania experience for children and parents, sparking positive
career conversations in a fun setting. Other partners, including the Public
Service Division and TAQWA Financial Services, have also come onboard,
with promising engagement from public service officers eager to volunteer
with M³.</p>

<p>Wakaf Masyarakat Singapura (WMS) was officially launched on 3 August 2024
by Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli. WMS, a new Islamic
Endowment Fund by the community for the community, creates a long-term
sustainable funding stream for the evolving needs of the Singapore Muslim
community.</p>
<p>The establishment of WMS comes back to two important reasons:</p>
<p>A good Islamic practice and tradition. Our forefathers have bequeathed
their land and properties for specific purposes that benefit the wider
community, as guided by Islamic principles. We now have 91 Wakaf, as an
Amanah, entrusted for us to preserve them for future generations. This
is a practice that we can learn from and build on – but the last wakaf
was contributed a long time back in 1978.</p>
<p>Renewing our mosque land leases. In the next 30 years, we will need at
least $300 million to renew our mosque land leases in quick succession.
Our existing community funds such as the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund
(MBMF) and Zakat can support the community’s current operation needs. But
in the long term, we need to do more to strengthen our religious institutions
such as madrasahs, and develop our Asatizah sector.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By establishing the WMS, we will allow ourselves a long runway to raise
smaller tranches of funds over time and generate a resilient income stream
to support our future growing needs.</p>
