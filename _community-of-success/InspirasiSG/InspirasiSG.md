Similarly, the campaign tagline “Hidup berbakti, ikhlas berbudi” means to do good without expecting anything in return.</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ln9v8g_36ss?si=Ad9EBsWF9AQKfi2z"></iframe></div><p></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/inspirasisg-event.jpeg"></div><h3><strong>Celebrating #InspirasiSG</strong></h3><p><em>Date: Sunday, 21st July 2019</em></p><p>Witness the results of #InspirasiSG, where we will announce the top 10 inspirational nominations.
