The academic successes are largely attributed to the strong community support through Malay/Muslim organisations such as MENDAKI, AMP, and LBKM through financial assistance, scholarships and bursaries and mentoring of our young leaders. The Singapore Government also complements these efforts through national initiatives to ensure a better future powered by bright minds from the Malay/Muslim community.</p>
