<h2><strong>Socio-Religious</strong></h2>
<p>A Malay/Muslim community bound by strong spiritual resilience and togetherness.</p>
<p>Singaporean Malay/Muslims have always played a pivotal role in fostering
community resilience, promoting interfaith understanding and nurturing
a deep sense of religious identity and belonging. Such contributions are
a testament to the MM community’s commitment to maintaining social and
religious harmony in Singapore – a shining example of unity in diversity.</p>
<h3><strong>International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS)</strong></h3>
<p>The first ICCOS was launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 9 September
2022. In the hope of sharing this vision to the global stage, which can
serve as an exemplary model for Muslim communities in contemporary societies,
Muis held the International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS)
as a platform for Muslim minority communities around the world to galvanise
around a strong narrative of success founded on the notion of “Contributing
Citizens, Dynamic Institutions”.</p>
