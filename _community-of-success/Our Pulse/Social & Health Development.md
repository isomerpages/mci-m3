<h3><strong>Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) Rehabilitation Network</strong></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore Prisons Service, and Central Narcotics
Bureau have been working with various MMOs to disseminate anti-drug messages,
conducting rehabilitation programmes for offenders, and providing support
to ex-offenders and their families. Following a series of focus group discussions
and townhall sharing sessions with the MMOs to improve the efforts in preventing
offending and re-offending, the MMOs expressed their interest to form a
rehabilitation network to strengthen their existing efforts and to provide
coordinated and holistic support to Malay offenders, ex-offenders, and
their families.</p>
<p>The Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) Rehabilitation Network was formed
and formalised by Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State,
Ministry of Home Affairs &amp; Ministry of National Development, on 30
November 2021. Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim leads the M3 Focus Area
2 efforts and heads the MMO Rehabilitation Network, providing strategic
guidance to rally and steer the collaborative efforts of the Network to
support efforts undertaken by the Ministry of Home Affairs and M3 Focus
Area 2.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>MMO Rehabilitation Network Conference 2024</strong></h4>
<p>The MMO Rehabilitation Network organised its inaugural conference on 25
January 2024 at Singapore Expo MAX Atria. Themed S.H.U.R.A 2024: Synergizing
Strengths for Collective Wisdom, it reflects the spirit of the MMOs coming
together to work towards the betterment of the inmates, ex-offenders, and
their families. The MMO Rehabilitation Network Conference 2024 seeks to
fulfil three objectives – (i) to galvanise closer collaboration amongst
stakeholders, (ii) to provide a better understanding on the programmes
and services offered by the MMOs, and (iii) to allow members to better
understand the needs of the MM inmates, ex-offenders, and their families.

agencies outside of the MMO Rehabilitation Network. They include KK Women’s
and Children’s Hospital, Singapore Children Society, Lions Befrienders,
