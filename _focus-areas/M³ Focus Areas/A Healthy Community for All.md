The Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board work closely with M³ agencies to support the initiatives. This work stream is led by Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Law.</p><h3><strong>Saham Kesihatan</strong></h3><p>As the flagship programme, Saham Kesihatan aims to encourage the Malay/Muslim community to adopt healthier lifestyles through the formation of community-led interest groups. These groups may design their own healthy lifestyle programmes to meet the needs of the participants within their own communities. The programme complements the <a href="https://www.healthiersg.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Healthier SG</u></a> movement, which focuses on individuals taking ownership towards better health and disease prevention through efforts such as regular health screening and adopting active lifestyles.</p>
