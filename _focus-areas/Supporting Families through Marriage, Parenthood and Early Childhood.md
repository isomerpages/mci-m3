<h2><strong>Programmes</strong></h2>

<p>To inspire strong and stable Muslim marriages, this ground-up initiative
by Kadi and Naib Kadi (marriage solemniser) with oversight from the Registry
of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) supports couples in their journey prior to their
solemnisation and throughout their first two years of marriage. Couples
begin their pre-marriage journey with a face-to-face meeting with their
selected Kadi or Naib Kadi prior to their solemnisation ceremony. The couples
are provided with pastoral support and a safe space to discuss sensitive
topics with their Kadi and Naib Kadi and encouraged to attend marriage
preparation programmes such as Cinta Abadi. They are also provided with
post-solemnisation support through other programmes, such as Project Arif
and Families for Life marriage and parenting programmes.</p>
<p>Since August 2023, the Bersamamu programme has been enhanced to include
9 female Asatizah (Islamic Religious teachers) to provide specialised support
to women and a safe space for them to share their issues on marriage and
family support.</p>
<p>About 30,000 couples have benefited from the Bersamamu programme as of
August 2024.</p>
