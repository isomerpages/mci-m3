<p>Our youth play a key role in the future of Singapore, and in our Malay/Muslim
community. We therefore endeavour to prepare our youth for what lies ahead,
developing their strengths and capabilities through mentoring programmes
that widen opportunities for various education and career pathways.</p>
<p>Apart from providing our youth with resources, schemes and training programmes,
mentoring is an equally important component of their development. Connecting
our youth with mentors and role models in the community helps guide and
inspire them to realise their potential.</p>
<p>Through our mentoring programmes, we aim to develop a vibrant Malay/Muslim
youth core, who are motivated to pay it forward and give back to the community.</p>
<p>This focus area is led by Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Minister of State, Ministry
of Digital Development and Information and Ministry of Health.</p>

<h3><strong>Youth Mentoring Office (YMO)</strong></h3>
<p>The Youth Mentoring Office (YMO) was set up within MENDAKI in August 2019,
to spearhead mentoring efforts in the Malay/Muslim community. It aims to
build a strong mentoring culture and ecosystem, where youth are connected
and actively contributing to the vision of a Community of Success. This
is achieved by adopting and contextualising the Gift-Centred Mentoring
(GCM) philosophy, a trademarked and evidence-based mentoring model from
the Youth Mentoring Connection (YMC) based in Los Angeles, USA, to enhance
and build the competency of the community.</p>

<p>YMO uses the GCM approach to build and enhance the capabilities and competencies
of our volunteer mentors and programme managers. Through the GCM training,
mentors will be equipped with skills to build successful relationships
with their mentees.</p>

</div>
<p>YMO provides continued support to trained mentors through sharing of resources
and Community of Practice (COP) sessions.</p>
<p>COP encourages deep learning and exchange of best practices amongst seasoned
and new mentors. It also focuses on specific mentor challenges such as
rapport building, goal setting, and working well with different personalities
amongst other topics. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIEd7EWcu1apONGn-nsVbnQ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> to

<h3><strong>Mentor Manual</strong></h3>
<p>YMO has produced a comprehensive manual titled ‘The Gift of Mentoring:
A Guide for Mentors’ to guide mentors in their mentoring journey. The manual
complements the GCM training that mentors undergo before deployment. Through
the use of infographics and videos, the manual provides information on
the GCM philosophy, tips to engage and build rapport with mentees, and
shares available resources that mentors can tap on to guide their mentees.</p>
