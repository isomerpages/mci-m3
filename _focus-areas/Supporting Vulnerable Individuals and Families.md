<p>The rehabilitation and reintegration journey for inmates and ex-offenders
can be filled with many challenges. Support from the community through
various in-care and aftercare programmes can help our inmates and ex-offenders
stay on course for long term desistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) works with other public agencies, and
community partners, to support inmates, ex-offenders, and their families
on the rehabilitation and reintegration journey. In addition to broad-based
programmes that are available to all inmates and ex-offenders, MHA also
works with Malay/Muslim (MM) organisations and the M<sup>3</sup> agencies,
to develop culturally-nuanced programmes to address the specific needs
of MM inmates, ex-offenders, and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This focus area is led by Associate Professor Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,
Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>FITRAH</strong></h4>
<p>The FITRAH (Family and Inmates Throughcare Assistance Haven) office was
set up in November 2018 to provide a more coordinated and holistic support
to MM inmates throughout their incarceration period, as well as their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>In-care Programmes</u>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>FITRAH provides a structured and values-centric religious programme for
MM inmates and also prepares Friday prayer sermons that are contextualised
to the rehabilitation needs of the MM inmates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On average, FITRAH conducts 30 Friday prayer sessions and 50 counselling
sessions weekly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH’s religious counsellors continue to extend their pro-social support
to inmates upon their release on a voluntary basis. This is in the form
of befriending or outreach to the individuals to participate in FITRAH’s
activities in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Aftercare Programmes and Support</u>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Befriending Support</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under FITRAH, volunteer befrienders that provide befriending support to
both ex-offenders and their families. The befrienders provide the ex-offenders
and their families with social and emotional support, and connect them
with the community to expand their pro-social network. The befrienders
also refer them to support systems in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Case Management Support&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH provide case management services to inmates emplaced on the community-based
programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 18-month case management programme adopt a family-centric approach
that supports the offenders and their immediate family members as well.</p>
<p><em>Referral Support through Home Visits</em>
</p>
<p>FITRAH collaborates with Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) volunteers
to visit offenders' families at home. These joint visits allow for a comprehensive
assessment of family needs. Based on this evaluation, families are linked
to suitable support services offered by various partnering organizations.
These partners include M<em><sup>3</sup></em>, the Malay/Muslim Organisations
(MMO) Rehabilitation Network, and other community support organisations.
Through these connections, families can access relevant social assistance
and programmes, such as the MENDAKI Tuition Programme and the Harun Ghani
Education Fund.</p>
<p><em>Back-to-FITRAH Package</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH officers and volunteers welcome ex-offenders who participate in
FITRAH aftercare programmes and services with the Back-To-FITRAH package
which includes fidyah vouchers, and an EZ-link card, helping to ease their
initial transition back into the community.</p>
<p><em>Support Group mentoring</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support group sessions and community activities are organised to facilitate
the integration of ex-offenders into the community and expand their pro-social
networks. FITRAH works with various MM support groups to organise community
activities to help expand their pro-social network and pro-social activities.
FITRAH also provides mentorship to the MM support groups by providing them
with guidance on their directions and focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Throughcare Programme</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Insan Mukmin</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH collaborates with PERGAS to develop and deliver the Insan Mukmin
programme. The programme provides participants with Islamic values and
mindset to aid them in their rehabilitation and reintegration journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completing the in-prison component of the Insan Mukmin programme
and emplacement to the community-based programme, the participants are
assigned a befriender to guide them towards pro-social and positive support
networks and facilitate their participation in the social activities organised
by various mosques.&nbsp;</p>

contact FITRAH.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Partnership with Mosques</strong></h4>
<p>FITRAH partners with our mosques for a referral process for families of
inmates to the network of 35 mosques disbursing zakat financial assistance.
At the mosques, families of inmates will be connected to support programmes,
as well as Islamic Education programmes under aLIVE, ADIL, and Home-based
Islamic Learning. In addition, FITRAH partners with mosques' asatizah to
provide religious programmes for inmates and befriending support for ex-offenders.
This approach ensures continuous spiritual and social care throughout the
rehabilitation process, from incarceration to reintegration in the community.</p>

<h4><strong>Family Excellence Circle by MENDAKI</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>MENDAKI supports Focus Area 2 efforts through a specially curated Family
Excellence Circle (FEC) Programme for families impacted by incarceration.</p>
<p>FEC consists of group work and casework support for families.&nbsp; The
facilitated group work sessions are meant to build the families’ resilience
and help them develop problem solving skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FEC provides a platform for the families to share their challenges and
build on their strengths. This also creates a network of support amongst
the families.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on their assessed areas of needs, FEC participants and children
will be supported through MENDAKI’s various programmes and services. Participants
and children will also be referred to other services and assistance provided
by Social Service Offices or Family Service Centres.</p>

<p>The project groups are led by Home Team officers and leaders from the
MMO partners of the Network, with many other MMOs taking up membership
within the respective groups.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, the groups will deep dive into their respective
areas, leveraging on the collective experience and knowledge to identify
needs and service gaps, and come up with feasible recommendations to further
strengthen support to offenders, ex-offenders and their families.</p>
