<p>Strong families are the foundation of strong communities.</p>
<p>Headed by Associate Professor Muhammad Faisal Ibrahim, this focus area
aims to provide a continuum of care and support for Malay and Muslim couples
and their families in the areas of marriage, parenting and early childhood
development.</p>
<h3><strong>Available Resources</strong></h3>
<p>The following community resources are available for couples and families
in the various M続@Towns:</p>
<h5><strong>KelasMateMatika@CC</strong></h5>
<p><em>Nurturing confidence in pre-schoolers, empowering parents and strengthening bonds between them</em>
</p>
<p>Piloted in September 2018, the 10-week programme by Yayasan Mendaki and
PA MESRA has benefitted more than 500 parents and children.&nbsp;In 2019,
the programme was expanded to all M続@Towns with support from the grassroots
organisations such as the Community Club Management Committees,&nbsp;Malay
Activity Executive Committees (MAECs) and Mosques. This programme is supported
by Temasek Foundation.</p>

<h5><strong>Pre-school Outreach</strong></h5>
<p><em>Championing the importance of pre-school education</em>
</p>
<p>Through the Pre-school Outreach programme, the Early Childhood Development
Agency (ECDA), works with pre-school outreach agencies, including Yayasan
MENDAKI, and community partners to promote the importance of pre-school
education, and to help families from low-income households to enrol their
children into pre-school. Outreach agencies also work closely with the
families to ensure regular attendance after enrolment.</p>
<h5><strong>Bersamamu</strong></h5>
<p><em>Supporting Muslim couples from before solemnisation to throughout their first two years of marriage</em>
</p>
<p>To inspire strong and stable Muslim marriages, this ground-up initiative
by Naib Kadi (marriage solemniser) supports couples in their journey from
before the big day and through the first two years of their lives together.
Couples begin their pre-marriage journey with a face-to-face meeting with
their selected Naib Kadi prior to their solemnisation ceremony. As of Sep
2020, over 5,700 couples have benefited from the programme.</p>
<h5><strong>Marital First Responder Training</strong></h5>
<p><em>Building community capability for strong marriages</em>
</p>
<p>The community plays an important role in supporting strong marriages and
family life. The Marital First Responder Training (MFR) is one way in which
the Ministry of Social and Family Development partners community stakeholders
to build the capability of community volunteers to provide basic marriage
advice and help. The first M続 MFR run was piloted at M続@Nee Soon in March
2019, and made possible with support from MAECs, mosques and MENDAKI. Since
then, 128 community partners and asatizah, including Kadis/Naib Kadis,
have been trained to provide basic marriage support to couples.</p>
