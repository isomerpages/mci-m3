<p>The rehabilitation and reintegration journey can be filled with many challenges.
Support from the community through various in-care and aftercare programmes
can help our inmates and ex-offenders stay on course for long term desistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) works with other public agencies, and
community partners, to support inmates, ex-offenders, and their families
on the rehabilitation and reintegration journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to broad-based programmes that are available to all inmates
and ex-offenders, MHA also works with MM organisations and the M<sup>3</sup> agencies,
to develop culturally-nuanced programmes to address the specific needs
of MM inmates, ex-offenders, and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This workstream is led by Associate Professor Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,
Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>FITRAH</strong></h3>
<p>The FITRAH (Family and Inmates Throughcare Assistance Haven) office was
set up in November 2018 to provide a more coordinated and holistic support
to MM inmates throughout their incarceration period, as well as their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Incare Programmes</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH has developed a structured and values-centric religious programme
for inmates. It also prepares Friday prayer sermons that are contextualised
to the rehabilitation needs of the inmate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On average, FITRAH conducts 30 Friday prayer sessions and 50 counselling
sessions weekly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH’s religious counsellors continue to extend their pro-social support
to inmates upon release on a voluntary basis. This could be in the form
of befriending or outreach to the individuals to participate in FITRAH’s
activities in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Aftercare Programmes and Support</u>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;<em>Befriending Support</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH has a pool of volunteer befrienders that provide befriending support
to both ex-offenders and their families. The befrienders provide the ex-offenders
and their families with social and emotional support, and connect them
with the community to expand their pro-social network. The befrienders
will also refer those who need, to support systems in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Case Management Support&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH provide case management services to inmates emplaced on the community-based
programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 18-month case management programme adopt a family-centric approach
that supports the offenders and their immediate family members as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Back-to-FITRAH Package</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH officers and volunteers receive ex-offenders at the prison gate
on their date of release, and welcome them with a Back-To-FITRAH package
which includes fidyah voucher, and an EZ-link card.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Support Group mentoring</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support group sessions and community activities are organised to facilitate
the integration of ex-offenders into the community and expand their pro-social
networks. FITRAH works with various MM support groups to organise community
activities to help expand their pro-social network and pro-social activities.
FITRAH also provides mentorship to the MM support groups by providing them
with guidance on their directions and focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Throughcare Programme</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Insan Mukmin</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FITRAH collaborates with PERGAS to develop and deliver the Insan Mukmin
programme. The programme provides participants with Islamic values and
mindset to aid them in their rehabilitation and reintegration journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completing the in-prison component of the Insan Mukmin programme
and emplacement to the community-based programme, the participants are
assigned a befriender to guide them towards pro-social and positive support
networks and facilitate their participation in the social activities organised
by various mosques.&nbsp;</p>

inmates to the network of 31 mosques disbursing zakat financial assistance.

as well as Islamic Education programmes under aLIVE, ADIL and Home-based
Islamic Learning. The mosques may also refer these families to MENDAKI’s

of families impacted by incarceration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
