<p>Rehabilitation is a challenging journey for offenders but with strong
support from the community as well as the availability of holistic in-care
and after-care programmes, they will have a better chance for reintegration
back into the community and minimise the likelihood of re-offending.</p>
<p>In partnership with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Singapore Prison
Service (SPS) and community organisations, M³ agencies provide holistic
support for offenders, ex-offenders, as well as their families so that
they will have opportunities for progress. This workstream is led by Associate
Professor Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State, Ministry of Home
Affairs and Ministry of National Development.</p>
<h3><strong>FITRAH</strong></h3>
<p>The FITRAH*&nbsp;(Family and Inmates Throughcare Assistance Haven) programme
by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) aims to provide integrated
and holistic support for inmates as well as their families - from in-care
to aftercare. The families will be connected to the necessary network of
assistance while their spouses who are in prison are duly supported with
in-care services.</p>
<p>A total of 385 families have benefitted from services offered by FITRAH,
which include befriending, referral for financial assistance, Islamic learning
at Mosques and referral to MENDAKI for employment and tuition for their
children.</p>
<p>To date, more than 330 volunteers, including religious counsellors, have
been recruited to support inmates and former inmates under FITRAH.</p>
<p>FITRAH continues to provide services via online platforms in the midst
of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Its services include:</p>
<h5><strong>Structured in-care religious programmes, including customised Friday Sermons</strong></h5>
<p>FITRAH deploys&nbsp;<em>Imams/Khatib</em>&nbsp;for Friday prayers &amp;
Hari Raya prayers, and religious counsellors for counselling sessions with
inmates. There are currently 130 religious counsellors.</p>
<p>These programmes address relevant issues and matters such as the pursuit
of religious guidance and the righteous path, as well as the importance
of staying optimistic in preparation for life after release.</p>
<h5><strong>Community Befriending</strong></h5>
<p>FITRAH has recruited more than 200 community befrienders to conduct joint
home visits to families of those incarcerated by Community Befrienders
and Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) volunteers, and to offer befriending
services to inmates in prisons and upon release.</p>
<h5><strong>Back-to-FITRAH Package</strong></h5>
<p>FITRAH officers and volunteers are deployed to receive ex-offenders at
the prison gate and give them a Back-To-FITRAH package which includes fidyah**&nbsp;voucher,
an EZ-link card, a prayer mat and an information package on assistance
available. 320 ex-offenders have benefitted from this initiative.</p>
<h5><strong>Partnership with Mosques</strong></h5>
<p>FITRAH partners with our mosques for a referral process for families of
inmates to the network of 31 mosques disbursing zakat financial assistance.
At the mosques, families of inmates will be connected to support programmes,
as well as Islamic Education programmes under aLIVE, ADIL and Home-based
Islamic Learning. The mosques may also refer these families to MENDAKI’s
programmes (for e.g. MENDAKI Tuition Scheme, SENSE programmes).</p>
<p>The FITRAH office is located at En-Naeem Mosque. You can also click&nbsp;

</a>&nbsp;to get in touch with FITRAH today.</p>
<h3><strong>Family Excellence Circle (FEC)</strong></h3>
<p>A Family Excellence Circle (FEC) group was specially curated by MENDAKI
for caregivers of children whose parents are/were incarcerated, to equip
families of offenders with school-going children.</p>
<p>The pilot group, which commenced in July 2019, had 12 members from nine
families – this created a safe and non-judgemental environment where members
could engage in open communication and sharing of experiences.</p>
<p>While the adults were engaged in the FEC, the children participated in
Art Therapy sessions, where they delved in arts and crafts to express their
feelings.</p>
<p>FEC members and their children had been connected to other MENDAKI programmes
and services, such as the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme, Mentoring @ MTS and other
developmental activities held at MENDAKI’s satellite centres.</p>
<h3><strong>Reintegration of Ex-offenders</strong></h3>
<p>To assist ex-offenders and their families in successfully reintegrating
into the society, Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MESRA) has
helped to recruit more Malay volunteers from PA’s grassroots network to
provide support to YRCP and its outreach efforts. This initiative was piloted
in M³@Bedok, M³@Woodlands and M³@Jurong. Now, more than 30% of YRCP members
in these pilot towns are Malays, as compared to 24.8% previously.</p>
<p>MESRA also offers SHIOK Series courses to ex-offenders and their family
members, so that they can pick up new skills and interact with other members
of the community.</p>

<h3><strong>Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) Rehabilitation Network</strong></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore Prisons Service and Central Narcotics
Bureau have been working with various MMOs to disseminate anti-drug messages,
conducting rehabilitation programmes for offenders, and providing support
to ex-offenders and their families. Following a series of focus group discussions
and townhall sharing sessions with the MMOs to improve the efforts in preventing
offending and re-offending, the MMOs expressed their interest to form a
rehabilitation network to strengthen their existing efforts and to provide
coordinated and holistic support to Malay offenders, ex-offenders, and
their families.</p>
