<p>On 12 March 2023, M³ established <strong>community health</strong> as its
fifth focus area. Supported by Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Ministry
of Health (MOH), it aims to empower the Malay/Muslim community to take
charge of their health. M³ Focus Area 5 (FA5) is led by Mdm Rahayu Mahzam,
Minister of State for Ministry of Digital Development and Information and
Ministry of Health.&nbsp; She is supported by Dr Wan Rizal, Member of Parliament
(MP) for Jalan Besar GRC, and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, MP for Ang Mo Kio
GRC. FA5 focuses on the following priority areas:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Priority 1: Support healthy ageing</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Malay/Muslim community partners promote and organise preventive health
and active ageing programmes, such as weekly exercise sessions, health
talks on mental well-being, and functional screening to tackle health issues
through active participation and promote healthy ageing among Malay/Muslim
seniors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M³ towns coordinate with HPB and MOH to conduct outreach efforts for Malay/Muslim
seniors as part of Healthier SG enrolment efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Priority 2: Improve screening rates</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Community partners raise awareness of health screening programmes offered
under Healthier SG and address common concerns and screening misconceptions
through talks to encourage Malay/Muslim residents to sign up for recommended
cancer and chronic disease screenings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malay/Muslim partners work HPB, MOH, Muslim Healthcare Professionals Association
(MHPA) and other whole-of-government partners to increase chronic disease
screening through health events and talks for the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Priority 3: Adopt a healthy lifestyle</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Malay/Muslim partners organise Saham Kesihatan and other health-promoting
programmes. Saham Kesihatan is a community-led initiative supported by
HPB which offers tailored, culturally sensitive health programmes. It complements
the Healthier SG movement, promoting individual health ownership through
prevention and active living.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M³@Towns and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JKJU</a>
<a href="#_msocom_1" class="msocomanchor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[CRMM1]</a>&nbsp; members partner with HPB to promote healthier eating
habits, especially during Ramadan and Hari Raya. They distributed grocery
packs featuring Healthier Choice Symbol products to Malay/Muslim residents
to reduce sugar and sodium consumption. Healthier SG talks, enrolment sessions,
and talks on preparing nutritious, affordable meals for families with young
children were also organised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Get Fit for Haj programme, a joint effort by HPB and Muis, supported
by the Association of Muslim Travel Agents Singapore (AMTAS) and the
<a href="https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.mhpa.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Muslim Healthcare Professionals Association (</a>MHPA), aims to better
prepare pilgrims for their Haj journey. This three-month programme, facilitated
by General Service Agents and HPB, includes strength exercises, brisk walking,
and health talks. Doctors from MHPA conduct sessions on improving fitness
and adopting healthy lifestyles, ensuring pilgrims are physically ready
for the Haj pilgrimage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Priority 4: Reduce smoking prevalence</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Malay/Muslim organisations raise awareness of community resources through
educational sessions aimed at helping individuals quit smoking and vaping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Priority 5: Improve mental well-being</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Malay/Muslim partners tap on existing resources such as HPB's peer support
workshops and 'Selangkah Bersama', an interactive Malay theatre programme
highlighting resilience, well-being, and positive role modelling. Additionally,
HPB's MindSG, a comprehensive online portal, offers self-care tools and
resources to help individuals understand and manage their health more effectively.</p>

<h3><strong>Jaga Kesihatan, Jaga Ummah</strong></h3>
<p>HPB introduced the Jaga Kesihatan, Jaga Ummah (JKJU)&nbsp;<em>(Look after your health, look after your community)</em>&nbsp;network
in 2017. It is made up of representatives from M<sup>3</sup>@Towns, Muis,
MENDAKI, Malay Activity Executive Committees (MAECs), mosques, Malay/Muslim
Organisations, MHPA, healthcare sectors, corporates and other Whole-of-Government
and social service organisations. With the set-up of M³ FA 5, the JKJU
network becomes integral to the overall efforts under FA 5.</p>
<p>The network offers a wide range of health promoting programmes to improve
the residents’ health and well-being, supporting the Malay/Muslim community
in leading healthy lifestyles.</p>
<p>HPB leverages the JKJU network to promote healthy lifestyles within the
Malay/Muslim community across the five priority areas of M³ FA 5 and bring
together the efforts of the community partners. This also supports the
overall Healthier SG efforts, which aim to empower Singaporeans to adopt
healthy lifestyles and support them with more health-promoting programmes
through collaborations with community partners.</p>
