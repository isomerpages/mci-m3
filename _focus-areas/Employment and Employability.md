<p>Given the evolving economic landscape, it is important to support the
Malay/Muslim (MM) community in remaining relevant and employable. By providing
essential skills development and career guidance, M³ empowers individuals
to seize available opportunities and thrive in the workforce.</p>
<p>Led by Mayor of South East District &nbsp;Fahmi Aliman and launched in
October 2020, this focus area aims to bridge our workers to employment
opportunities to meet their immediate needs, as well as enhance the capability
of our workforce through skills upgrading and lifelong learning initiatives,
thereby strengthening their resilience and ensuring their employability
in the future.</p>
<p>This focus area supports a wide spectrum of the community, including mature
jobseekers (40 years and above), mid-career switchers, fresh graduates,
young workers, women looking to re-enter the workforce, platform workers
and vulnerable workers.</p>
<h4><strong>Ecosystem of Support</strong></h4>
<p>The rapid pace of technological innovation is revolutionising the job
market, rendering certain industries obsolete and transforming the skills
required for success. To remain competitive in this dynamic landscape,
individuals must proactively acquire new knowledge and skills. Our ecosystem,
including NTUC's e2i (Employment and Employability Institute), NTUC LearningHub
(NTUC LHUB), SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), Lifelong Learning Institute
(LLI), Workforce Singapore (WSG), and MENDAKI, offers a comprehensive range
of resources designed to assist workers in adapting to the evolving demands
of the future of work.</p>
<p>By providing targeted initiatives and short-term training programs, we
empower individuals to transition seamlessly into emerging fields and industries.
These programs equip workers with the essential skills and competencies
needed to thrive in the job market, such as digital literacy, data analytics,
artificial intelligence, and automation. By investing in the development
of our workforce, we can increase employment opportunities, enhance productivity,
and ensure Singapore's continued economic prosperity in the face of technological
disruption.</p>
<h4><strong>Partnerships and collaborations</strong></h4>
<p>NTUC with NTUC’s e2i, NTUC LearningHub, Workforce Singapore (WSG), Lifelong
Learning Institute (LLI) and MENDAKI, through career fairs and the recent
Jobs &amp; Skills Carnival, assisted approximately more than 6,000 Malay/Muslim
workers and close to 20% them had received further coaching and guidance
through Focus Area 4’s (FA4) initiatives. This includes career guidance,
job matching and upskilling opportunities.</p>
<p>This partnership has strengthened coordination and collaboration in M<sup>3</sup> networks
in the delivery of relevant employment and employability programmes. For
example, the NTUC Women and Family (WAF) and MENDAKI had worked together
to provide link ups between the WAF’s Women Supporting Women Mentoring
Programme and MENDAKI’s Women At Work (W@W) programme, where the W@W participants
were referred to NTUC’s e2i for career coaching and job assistance through
NTUC’s WAF.</p>

<p>FA4 employs a multi-faceted communication strategy to reach a broader
audience and raise awareness of its initiatives. This includes the use
of podcasts and radio programs as valuable platforms for disseminating
information about career opportunities, skills development programmes,
and other relevant resources. These channels allow for in-depth discussions,
sharing of expert insights, and direct engagement with listeners, making
them effective tools for fostering awareness and interest.</p>
<p>In addition to broadcast media, FA4 actively organizes community events
and dialogue sessions to facilitate engagement with the Malay/Muslim community.
These gatherings provide a valuable face-to-face opportunity for individuals
to ask questions, seek advice, and learn more about the available support
services. By combining these diverse communication channels, FA4 has been
able to effectively reach and engage a wide range of individuals, promoting
awareness and participation in its initiatives.</p>

<p>Union leaders, acting as trusted intermediaries, play a pivotal role in
connecting jobseekers with relevant employment opportunities within FA4's
Greenlane business partners. Through personalised home visits, the union
leaders engage in in-depth conversations with residents to understand the
individual's specific needs, career aspirations, and unique challenges.
This empathetic approach allows union leaders to build rapport and gain
valuable insights that facilitate the job matching process for residents.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a deep understanding of each jobseeker's qualifications, skills,
and preferences, union leaders actively seek out suitable roles within
FA4's Greenlane network. They leverage their industry knowledge and relationships
to identify companies that align with the jobseeker's career goals and
offer promising opportunities for growth and development. By carefully
matching the jobseeker to &nbsp;appropriate positions, union leaders help
to ensure a seamless transition into the workforce and contribute to the
overall success of both jobseekers and employers.</p>
