<h2>Be an Organisation Volunteer with<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>M³</h2>
<p><em>Deepen Your Organisation’s Social Impact with Project Dian's M³ Approach</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organisations can play a bigger part in creating change and impact in
society. By participating in Project Dian, your organisation can actively
contribute to improving the well-being of families in public rental flats.
You can play a pivotal role in guiding young families towards achieving
self-reliance and social mobility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organisation Volunteer (OV) initiative by M³ is aligned with ForwardSG’s
plans to reach a shared future. Organisations collaborate with M³ to identify
staff members interested in taking on volunteer roles, such as those with
Project Dian. This extends the spirit of volunteerism beyond individuals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, your involvement can motivate and support these families
in their journey towards home ownership, leveraging existing national schemes
and community programmes such as MSF’s ComLink and support provided by
HDB’s Housing Support Team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Join us in making a tangible difference in the lives of these families
and in shaping a more inclusive and empowered community. Together, we can
uplift the lower-income families and nurture a stronger culture of giving
among organisations.</p>
<h1>Project Dian</h1>
<p>Project Dian is an M3 initiative to showcase the community’s Determination
to support households in public rental flats through the Integration of
Assets within the community and the instilling of values (Nilai).</p>
<p></p>
<p>It aims to improve the well-being of families in public rental flats by
providing wrap-around care and empower them to achieve self-reliance and
social mobility. Young families will be motivated and guided towards home
ownership by leveraging on existing national schemes and community programmes
such as MSF’s ComLink and support provided by HDB’s Housing Support Team</p>
<h2>Be a Volunteer Befriender</h2>
<p>Volunteers play an important role in Project Dian by understanding the
needs of the families and their aspirations. Befrienders to the families
will also motivate and encourage them in their journey to achieve self-reliance
and pursue positive outcomes. Volunteers will also be equipped with basic
skills and knowledge to provide assistance and advice to the families,
especially about owning their own homes, where possible.</p>
