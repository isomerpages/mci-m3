<p><em>Deepen Your Organisation’s Social Impact with Project Dian's M³ Approach</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organisations can play a bigger part in creating change and impact in
society. By participating in Project Dian, your organisation can actively
contribute to improving the well-being of families in public rental flats.
You can play a pivotal role in guiding young families towards achieving
self-reliance and social mobility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organisation Volunteer (OV) initiative by M³ is aligned with ForwardSG’s
plans to reach a shared future. Organisations collaborate with M³ to identify
staff members interested in taking on volunteer roles, such as those with
Project Dian. This extends the spirit of volunteerism beyond individuals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, your involvement can motivate and support these families
in their journey towards home ownership, leveraging existing national schemes
and community programmes such as MSF’s ComLink and support provided by
HDB’s Housing Support Team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Join us in making a tangible difference in the lives of these families
and in shaping a more inclusive and empowered community. Together, we can
uplift the lower-income families and nurture a stronger culture of giving
among organisations.</p>
