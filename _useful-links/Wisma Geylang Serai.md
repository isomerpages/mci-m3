The WGS hub is a culturally distinctive and inclusive multi-agency development that celebrates the heritage of Geylang Serai and all other local communities so as to encourage social interaction and community bonding across all ages and races. It houses the Geylang Serai Community Club, South East Community Development Council, Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery, arts houses as well as other social and community-related facilities.</p>
